## Purpose and rationale for the constitutional change and its intended outcomes


Many Swarm Network members feel a lack of structure and community engagement at the Swarm Foundation. Therefore, we believe that the duties of the SNC have come to require an upgrade and to be described in greater detail. 


## Identify the specific uses for which any Swarm Treasury funds may be expended to support the Governance Action;

This proposal has no request for funds associated with it.
