# Swarm Masternodes Fund

## Description of the proposed change to Swarm Network Policy
Vote YES or NO to approve or disapprove of the entire GAP. If YES, then Multi-Option choices are below.

Adjusting the masternodes staking contracts. From every monthly payment to each node, a chosen % can be automatically sent to a secure wallet over the course of:

A) 3 years;

B) 5 years;

from its inception date, at the (monthly) percentage rate of:

A) 12.5%; 

B) 10%; 

C) 5% + 2.5% for each following year up to a maximum of 15%, regardless of the duration of this initiative.

This particular GAP only focuses on approving the creation of the Swarm Masternodes Fund and a few basic rules to begin saving as soon as possible. It DOES NOT decide when or how the funds will be used. Deployment of funds will be decided at the right time and with dedicated GAPs. 

New GAPs to improve the Swarm Masternodes Fund are welcome. 

If a future GAP will be approved to entirely cancel the Swarm Masternodes Fund, ALL of the tokens in the SMF will be returned to the original wallets in a way proportionate to their original contribution.

Despite the number of nodes possibly changing with time, you can see that the percentage of yearly rewards set aside for the Swarm Masternodes Fund is expected to remain fixed at the chosen rate for the chosen amount of time, as it is simply a percentage of the pool being paid out.

Any of the above rules and timeline can be amended in the future by a new GAP.


If this GAP is agreed upon, the Swarm Network commits to implement the changes and start the Swarm Masternodes Fund by the end of April 2020, and no later than the end of May 2020. 

It will also require the creation of a multisig Ethereum address administered and protected by the Swarm Council. It will need at least 3 signatures or a similarly secure protection in accordance to the Swarm Network’s own standards. 

The community will be made aware of the identity of those Council members holding the signatures to access the Swarm Masternodes Fund. 

A new GAP in the future will consider the creation of a (Aragon) DAO that will vote on how to deploy the funds.

The Ethereum wallet containing the Swarm Masternodes Fund will be made public.

## Purpose and rationale for the policy change and its intended outcomes
Each node will only contribute barely 2000 SWM tokens (very likely less) across the total 5-year period, in order to save up to 700,000+ SWM overall.

Through a new GAP, the Swarm Masternodes Fund could keep a number of MNs running until the Swarm Network will decide on ways to deploy the funds or rabalance it with other cryptocurrencies. 

The Swarm Masternodes Fund would foster a climate of collaboration between members, nurturing engagement and the discussion of ideas enriching the network’s strength, development and reach.

I would like to remind the community that the real goal of masternodes isn’t to only receive decreasing yearly rewards, but to process an increasing number of MAP (Market Access Protocol) transactions. Therefore, I find it very beneficial in the long-term to begin saving a few SWM tokens independent from the Swarm Treasury itself, with the goal of fostering adoption, utility and development.


## Additional information for Governance Actions requiring the expenditure of Swarm Treasury funds

It will bear no cost as any necessary change to the Masternode rewards delivery will be done in-house by developers of the Swarm Network community.
