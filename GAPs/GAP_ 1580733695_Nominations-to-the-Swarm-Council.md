# Nominations to the Swarm Council

## Description of the proposed Governance Action

Up/Down for each of the three nominations below.

1) Timo Lehes’ term on the SNC will end on March 25, 2020; a YES will nominate Aravinda Babu for the open seat. Aravinda Babu has been a long-time contributor to the Swarm Network. His profile can be found at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/linuxchip/

2) As part of the two additional seats available at the Swarm Network Council, a YES will nominate Alex Cornwell for the open seat. Alex Cornwell has been a long-time contributor to the Swarm Network and to Swarm Capital. His profile can be found at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexncornwell 

(*Contingent to the approval of ‘GAP_ 1580637031_Council-Seats-Upgrade’.)

3) As part of the two additional seats available at the Swarm Network Council, a YES will nominate Alex Masi for the open seat. Alex Masi has been a long-time contributor to the Swarm Network, his profile can be found at: https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alexmasi

(*Contingent to the approval of ‘GAP_ 1580637031_Council-Seats-Upgrade’.)

If the concurrent ‘GAP_ 1580637031_Council-Seats-Upgrade’ (from 5 to 7) is not agreed upon in order to make further seats available, the nominated members above will start their term on the Swarm Network Council one at the time, following the above order, whenever one of the five seats becomes vacant**.

## Purpose and rationale for the Governance Action and its intended outcomes 

With a positive vote to the three nominations above, two Swarm Capital representatives will remain on the SNC, while five will be unrelated to Swarm Capital. 

This balance will nurture mutual long-term trust and cooperation, opening much needed communication channels at various levels, looking forward to have both entities add value to the Swarm Network in the way they deem most appropriate to their goals.

## Identify the specific uses for which Swarm Treasury funds may be expended to support the Governance Action
