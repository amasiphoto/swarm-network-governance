Swarm Masternodes Fund

## Description of the proposed change to Swarm Network Policy

1) This GAP is to initially adjust the Masternodes staking contracts so that from each monthly payment to the respective Ethereum addresses, a chosen % can be automatically taken at 'claim', and sent to a secure wallet under control of the foundation for 5 years from its inception, according to the data shown below:

A) 12.5%;
B) 10%;
c) 5% + 2.5% for each following year; (5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%)

Each node would only contribute a maximum of 1788 SWM tokens (or less) in a 5 year period, as outlined here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zx5krx-mPaxVYQsyusGHkbWDYWIdCS5c2EUyV9h-gLU/edit?usp=sharing

2) To create a secure multisig address administered by the foundation. (If we want to set nodes up, somebody is going to have to be in charge of the nodes, and  transfers/payments/rebalancing/etcetras...according to future votes.)
 
3) To introduce a yearly confidence vote on the Swarm Masternodes Fund which may result in closure and restitution of tokens to the original depositing addresses, although this is unlikely. 

4) To allow for new GAPs to be submitted in relation to the Swarm Masternode Fund at any available time. 
													

## Purpose and rationale for the policy change and its intended outcomes

- Each node would only contribute barely 1788 SWM tokens (or less) in a 5 year period. The benefits of having up to 800,000 SWM on the side, outweights such a small contribution towards the network, in my opinion.		

- The fund could keep some MNs running until the network will decide how to rebalance it at the appropriate time and price range, after voting some time in the next few years.		

- Could be an ideal way to avoid touching anything from the foundation too early on. We should consider to still have at least a few millions SWM in the foundation in 5 years' time. It would go in the interests of the network to set something aside now, when rewards are still high. 

As suggested, since the real goal of the nodes isn't to just get yearly decreasing block rewards, but to receive an increasing number of MAP transactions in time, I don't see it as a problem to set a few SWM aisde, if the plan is to use them to increase sustainability, adoption and utility long-term. 															

- It would foster a climate of collaboration between masternodes, to open discourse, grow engagement, discuss ideas in depth and improve/contribute towards the network. As we shall preserve the foundation for critical needs, this smaller fund could be a fairly inexpensive experiment to start collaborating.			

- The network can keep track of each node's contributions over the years. If the network will someday vote to close the fund entirely, each node's contribution could still be tracked and returned. Take note that this is however, unlikely.															

- Further votes will be brought about to decide what could be done with the treasury, if/when to rebelance a part of it, if/when to close it and redistribute the tokens to the original wallets and all that doesn't pertain this single initial step.															
11- In my opinion, it is foreseable that the masternode fund will not be simply voted down by any of the future Swarm holders as it'd go against their interests. 

It is  likely that some MNs might have sold before seeing any benefits from the treasury itself, but having contributed to it monthly, albeit just a little bit. If any node will decide to leave the network, the MN rewards shall simply rebalance themselves up and other people wanting to stay longer term could easily get onboard with decent returns.
